# COSC 70 (22F) Final Project - Neural Network
## Julian George

## Summary
For the final project of COSC 70 - Foundations of Applied Computer Science, we applied all of the linear algebra concepts to build a neural network from scratch, building a multilayered MLP model to tackle the classic MNIST problem. The process of building the neural network itself was straight forward, but the interesting (and fun) part was tuning the hyperparameters to get the best performance possible. I experimented with different activation functions, implemented a basic optimizer, and graphed & analyzed my results. It was fascinating to learn and implement these concepts on a basic, mathematical level, instead of just relying on prebuilt libraries.
